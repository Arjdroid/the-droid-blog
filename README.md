# the_droid_blog-source_files

This repository is a repository meant to contain the source files that I will use in order to construct [my blog website](https://arjdroid.github.io). My website is constructed using the [hugo website construction engine](https://gohugo.io), a tool that takes .md files as input and uses them, along side a theme, to generate multiple static html pages within a master directory that can be used as a static website.

## Flexibility

The static pages built with the [hugo engine](https://gohugo.io) are very flexible in terms of their appearance and the devices which they can be viewed upon. The specific hugo theme which I have used, is [gruvbox](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox) with slight modifications to make it more to my liking.
