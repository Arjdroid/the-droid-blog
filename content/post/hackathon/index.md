## Introduction

A little over a month ago, I decided to participate in an upcoming hackathon. For those not in the know, a [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon), sometimes also called a codefest, is an event where people work in teams to rapidly develop a product within a set time limit. They can come in the form of a competition where the goal is for one team to win, or, when hosted by a company, to complete the implementation of a feature in their product.

They are usually 24 hours continuous, but some can span to two or three days.

I have never really had much formal coding experience, mostly just moving around and playing with with things like linux and docker instead, with the ocassional python or shell scripting, as this blog has shown. 

This was going to be the first time I did some 'real' programming; I was very excited.

## Advice

I don't want to bore you with the details so let me just list some advice I thought would be obvious / I wish I knew beforehand
