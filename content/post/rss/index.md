> If you wish to subscribe to my [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed so that you may be alerted to new blog posts quickly, you may enter this as the feed's URL:
>
> ```
> url = https://arjdroid.github.io/index.xml
> ```

Once you enter this as the URL for the RSS feed reader, it will automatically fetch the RSS feed from this website.

These are some of my favourite RSS feed readers (although I'm still sad that Google Reader is dead) -

* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) - This one has a free and paid tier but either way, it's really convenient and accessible from almost every platform
* [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) - This is self-hosted (I might write a blog post on how to host it some other time) but it's open source and heavily customisable
* [Feeder](https://feeder.co/) - Very similar to the other two but more integrated with browsers via dedicated extensions, closed source
