## Introduction

It's been a while since I've last posted here...

Over half a year, in fact!

It just spiraled into an unending spiral of 'I'll do it next week's that cascaded into the oblivion that is the void of the land of the forgotten or, as some of you might be familiar with ;

``` bash
/dev/null
```

Here's something that I want to try out. Is it possible for me to have _more than one_ picture in a **single** post?

If I'm successful, it should be right here :

![Hibiscus Picture](test-picture2.jpg)

And voila! Through the power of hindsight, I can see that I'm successful with my attempt (at least it works on my system, your mileage may vary...)
