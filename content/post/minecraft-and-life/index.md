There is this 'long-proverb?' floating around the internet about a conversation between a fisherman and a businessman about their approaches to life.

[Insert Exact Transcript]

The gist of it is that the fisherman lives a life of fishing till they're satisfied and they get to do whatever they want, being their own boss, etc.

While the businessman encourages them to 'grind' on their fishing business and expand, with the end goal of 'financial freedom' and getting to do whatever they want.

I was reminded of this story when I was watching a friend of mine play Minecraft.

They were doing it in a leisurely fashion, just mining for the sake of it, with their inventory slowly amassing bits of iron ore (_or raw iron as they like to call it now..._).

I was slightly irked upon seeing this.

I tried bestowing unto them the virtues of settling in a Minecraft village, and going through the sludge that is the villager trading process, to come out of it with multiple iron farms and villagers that can provide me a full set of perfect diamond armour and tools.

That it was a waste of time to go through the old process of trying to find diamonds in the caves.

[need to ameliorate point conveyance here] My point was that, at the end, they would be well equipped to go into the caves and have fun.

[make it less direct] They said that they were doing that already.

[here's where the nuance comes in]

And then I realised that they were like the fisherman from that old proverb and I, the businessman, pushing them to go through that grind and come out of it to finally have fun.

Through this analogisation, I also saw another aspect that might not be as transparent in the original proverb - the quality of life.

Of course, the end goal is nominally the same in that, at the end, both want to have freedom over what they do. However, the material comforts vastly differ.

By grinding for that better gear, or more money and better quality of living, you do come out more comfortable at the end, compared to the proverbial fisherman.

Sure, the fisherman has their freedom, but only in the simpler things, but for creature comforts and material things, he has very little. Their sacrifice is that.
