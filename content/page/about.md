## About Me

I am Arjun, the creator of this blog. If you were to ask me to describe myself in two lines, I'd say, "Curious about the world, tinkering with software, radios, and coffee. I also like taking pictures and walking and talking.".

I don't prefer to define myself by my interests, as they would be too long to list. I instead try to enjoy all that life has to offer. I like to talk to those more knowledgable than myself in many domains, from linguistics and etymology to fundamental physics and greek mythology. I am a sucker for good Sci-Fi, whether in film or novel form, I will probably put up a booklist for Sci-Fi.

I also happen to enjoy the simpler pleasures of food, exercise, and videogames.

## About The Website

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a relatively simple, open-source engine for building great static HTML websites.

The Hugo theme that I am using is [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/), by [Jimmy Cai](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/)

This website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) (specifically, Github Pages), a fantastic resource enabling open-source content to be distributed accessibly worldwide.

Most of the edits were made in [Atom](https://atom.io) a 'hackable text editor for the 21st century'.

Nowadays I primarily use [Zed](https://zed.dev) as Atom is no longer supported. I have tried getting into [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), `vim`, and `helix` but they are quite immense and I have not explored it as much yet.

My preferred Linux distro of choice has hopped, from Pop!\_OS to Arch Linux and now Fedora, although I primarily operate off a MacBook now.

All the photographs that appear on this website are shot by me, either on an [Olympus](https://www.olympus-global.com/) [OMD E-M10 Mark II](https://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/om_d_system_cameras/om_d/e_m10_mark_ii/index.html) micro-four-thirds digital mirrorless camera or on my smartphone or are screenshots taken by me, on my devices.

I am the sole rights holder for copyrightable content on this website including, but not limited to, the images and text.
