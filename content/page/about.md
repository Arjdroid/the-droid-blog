## About Me

I am Arjun, the maker/owner of this blog.

I like almost all things computer related, and am a big fan of open-source technologies.
I also like other things like playing videogames, doing sports (mostly Basketball these days), eating food, travelling, reading, photography and hanging out with my friends.

Additionally, I am a licensed ham radio operator in my home country, India. My callsign (restricted grade) is VU3EWS.

### My Favourite Foods (All Vegetarian) and Videogames

## About The Website

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a relatively simple, open-source engine for building great static HTML websites.

The Hugo theme that I am using is [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/), by [Jimmy Cai](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/)

This website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) (specifically, Github Pages), a fantastic resource enabling open-source content to be distributed accessibly worldwide.

Most of the edits were made in [Atom](https://atom.io) a 'hackable text editor for the 21st century' supplemented by a [zsh](https://zsh.org) command shell running on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) in the [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) Terminal.

Nowadays I use [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) alongside [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) as Atom is no longer supported. I have tried getting into [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) but it is quite immense and I have not explored it as much yet.

All the photographs that appear on this website are shot by me, either on an [Olympus](https://www.olympus-global.com/) [OMD E-M10 Mark II](https://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/om_d_system_cameras/om_d/e_m10_mark_ii/index.html) micro-four-thirds digital mirrorless camera or on my smartphone or are screenshots taken by me, on my devices. 

I am the sole rights holder for all the copyrightable content on this website including, but not limited to, the images and text.
