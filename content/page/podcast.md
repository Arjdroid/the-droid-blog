## My Favourite Podcasts

I enjoy Podcasts. They are unique from other means of entertainment (apart from the very similar Audiobooks and music) that can be consumed without having to directly look at, or be occupied by them; thus allowing one to perform other, often menial, tasks without succumbing to mind numbing boredom.

Currently, my favourite podcasts range across a wide variety of topics, some of which I have listed below:


One of my favourite podcasts focuses more on the technical side of the field of Economics, it is [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money) by NPR and it's more miniature weekday podcast, [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator). Every episode, these podcasts explore fun stories about the world and analyse them through the lens of economics, often explaining concepts in the subject on the way.

Another great podcast is [Freakonomics Radio](https://freakonomics.com/). It is a unique show that delves into "the hidden side of everything" and is more quirky and less 'educational' than Planet Money. They explore more quirky topics and have generally longer episodes.


[Waveform: The MKBHD Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/Waveform) is an extension of the MKBHD Youtube channel. Episodes are generally an hour and 5 minutes long and they cover the latest in tech news. Episodes don't adhere strictly to a specific format but they know how to make an interesting episode. Generally they have episodes which are in one of two formats, either a regular progression through different bits of technology-centric news for the week along with other fun segments. They also have specific episodes where they interview people, often fellow Youtube creators on aspects of their craft.

The [Vergecast](https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast) is another similar tech podcast on the same Vox Media Network as WVFRM but with different hosts which lends it more of a "professional" look and feel. They are a part of the [Verge](https://www.theverge.com/) which is reputable in the tech journalism space and thus have access that has allowed them to interview some of the highest ranking and most exclusive people in the tech industry.

One of the pioneers of the podcast format is [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) by Roman Mars. Every episode gives light to the profound role yet often overlooked role that design plays in our everyday lives (hence the name, 99% Invisible). They have a wide range in terms of the topics they address but each and every episode is of the highest quality in all aspects including production quality and writing.

There is a peculiar, yet surprisingly entertaining podcast, [Everything is Alive](http://www.everythingisalive.com/) by Radiotopia which is based on the premise of personifying regular everyday objects, as simple
